### **PBI-2024-045: Restaurant Order AI Agent Implementation**
**Type:** Product Backlog Item | **Story Points:** 8 | **Priority:** 1

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I need to implement a complete restaurant order AI agent with custom function tools so that customers can place orders through natural language conversations.

**Requirements:**
1. **Azure AI Agent Setup**
   - Complete the FunctionTool creation from user_functions
   - Configure ToolSet and enable auto function calls
   - Create agent with proper restaurant order instructions
   - Set up conversation thread management

2. **Custom Function Implementation** 
   - Complete `calculate_order_total()` function logic for menu pricing
   - Complete `process_restaurant_order()` function for order workflow
   - Define and populate `user_functions` Set for agent function discovery

3. **Agent Communication Flow**
   - Import required Azure AI SDK models (FunctionTool, ToolSet, MessageRole, ListSortOrder)
   - Implement message creation and thread processing
   - Add run status checking and error handling
   - Display agent responses and conversation history

4. **Resource Management**
   - Implement proper agent cleanup and deletion
   - Handle conversation thread lifecycle

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- âœ… Agent connects to Azure AI Foundry without errors
- âœ… Custom functions are properly exposed in user_functions Set
- âœ… Functions are automatically discovered and called by agent
- âœ… Order processing calculates totals correctly and saves files
- âœ… Agent maintains conversation context throughout interactions
- âœ… Error handling prevents crashes and provides meaningful messages
- âœ… Resources are properly cleaned up after use
