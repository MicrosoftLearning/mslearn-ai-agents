### **PBI-2024-045: Restaurant Order AI Agent Implementation**
**Type:** Product Backlog Item | **Story Points:** 8 | **Priority:** 1

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I need to implement a complete restaurant order AI agent with custom function tools so that customers can place orders through natural language conversations.

**Requirements:**
1. **Azure AI Infrastructure Setup**
   - Set up Azure AI Foundry project with GPT-4o deployment
   - Configure environment variables and authentication
   - Establish AgentsClient connection with DefaultAzureCredential

2. **Order Processing Functions**
   - Create `calculate_order_total()` function with menu pricing logic
   - Implement `process_restaurant_order()` function for complete workflow
   - Functions must return JSON responses and handle invalid menu items
   - Generate unique order numbers using UUID and save orders to files

3. **AI Agent Configuration**
   - Import Azure AI SDK classes (FunctionTool, ToolSet, MessageRole)
   - Create FunctionTool from user functions and configure ToolSet
   - Enable auto function calls and set up conversation threads
   - Write agent instructions for restaurant order context

4. **Error Handling and Cleanup**
   - Check run status for failures and display error messages
   - Implement proper agent and thread resource cleanup
   - Add input validation and handle edge cases gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- âœ… Agent connects to Azure AI Foundry without errors
- âœ… Custom functions are automatically discovered and called by agent
- âœ… Order processing calculates totals correctly and saves files
- âœ… Agent maintains conversation context throughout interactions
- âœ… Error handling prevents crashes and provides meaningful messages
- âœ… Resources are properly cleaned up after use

### **PBI-2024-046: Conversation History and Logging**
**Type:** Product Backlog Item | **Story Points:** 3 | **Priority:** 2

**User Story:**  
As a restaurant manager, I need to see the full conversation history between the agent and customers so that I can review order interactions and improve service quality.

**Requirements:**
- Retrieve and display conversation history in chronological order
- Show clear distinction between customer and agent messages
- Include all function call results in conversation log
- Maintain conversation state throughout the session

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- âœ… Complete conversation log displayed at end of session
- âœ… Messages shown in chronological order with proper role identification
- âœ… All message types (user, agent, function results) are captured
- âœ… History display works consistently across different conversation lengths
